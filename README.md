This repository showcases the latest iteration of the chatbot website I developed. The project utilizes React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, and it has been deployed to GitHub Pages via terminal commands. I optimized the Google Gemini API with customized system instructions to enhance its functionality. Additionally, I integrated a button utilizing the Web Speech API to deliver robust text-to-speech capabilities, significantly improving user engagement and accessibility. The project code is available under the gh-pages branch.
